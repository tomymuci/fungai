    resulting from mushroom poisonings across the world - with 50% coming from
    Amanita Phalloides (Death Cap Mushroom). Its most noticeable species is the

    The Boletus genus are ectomycorrhizal fungi, forming symbiotic relationships between
    the root systems of certain plants (including trees), providing immune support
    and aiding nutrient exchange between the ecosystem. The Boletus genus contains a
    few edible mushrooms, with the most notable being Boletus Edulis.

    Most Entoloma have gray and bland color pallets, but some species found in
